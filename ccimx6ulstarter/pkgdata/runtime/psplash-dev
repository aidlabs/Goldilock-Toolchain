DESCRIPTION_psplash-dev: PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It has few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and handles rotation. Its visual look is configurable by basic source changes. Also included is a \'client\' command utility for sending information to psplash such as boot progress information.  This package contains symbolic links, header files, and related items necessary for software development.
